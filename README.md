Gesture
=======

Gesture.js uniformizes pointer and gestures input across mobile and desktop browsers.
The code comes from ViniSketch Toolkit and was influenced by Pointer.js 
from borismus and his article: http://smus.com/mouse-touch-pointer/ . 

The mains difference with Pointer.js are:
* we do not change default add/removeEventListenener
* we try to minimize the use of "createEvent" method that creates bugs with complexes situations
* It supports IE10 (Pointer and Gesture)

The lib works on w8-IE10, Chrome, Safari, FireFox, Android stock browser,
Android Chrome, Android FireFox, iOS, FireFox OSâ€¦
